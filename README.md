# Pygame project
This is a little game I made using the Pygame module as the final project for Advanced Course in Programming (TKT10003, 5 cr) for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

The monsters move randomly, the coins spawn randomly and collision detection is used to determine if a coin is picked up and whether the game ends after being touched by a monster.

To play, clone the repo, install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install Pygame https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted and run main.py
